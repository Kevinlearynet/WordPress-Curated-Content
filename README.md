WordPress Curated Content
=========================

WordPress plugin used for curating content from Google Reader's starred items feed. The `themes` folder includes a theme files I'm currently using to power the [curated web design resources](http://www.kevinleary.net/curated/) section of my site. 

The `template-curated-rss.php` template is used to automate a weekly [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/) RSS to Email campaign.
